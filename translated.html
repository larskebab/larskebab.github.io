    <h2>Service</h2>
    <p>Hey! My name is Lars and I am a web developer. My aim is to help small and starting businesses to grow and update their digital presence. I do this by building professional and responsive websites that will be true to your identity and can promote your business. I find communication and openness of the utmost importance, this way you will know exactly what to expect.</p>
    <p>I have a few years of expierence with web development. Though, since I am just starting out with this business, I can help you for very reasonable fees. I will also deliver a free prototype on which you can decide if you want to work with me. This way neither party will be disappointed in the end!</p>

    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Having a business means taking care of a lot of things and your online appearance might not be on the top of that list. Nowadays though, how you are viewed online can mean a lot for the amount of costumers you will get. This is why it is very important that you have a clean and clear website that can easily be found. This is exactly what I will help you with. Increasing your accesibility will help your business get of the ground or give it a boost.</p>
    <p>Responsive web design is something that is becoming more and more important and thus I will have a great focus on this aspect of web design. I added a video that explains exactly what this is below.</p>
    <p>If there any further questions or if you are interested in my service, feel free to contact me with the contact info at the bottom of the page.</p>
